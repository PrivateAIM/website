## Introduction and Overview

We have drafted this privacy policy (version 01.12.2021-311891618) to explain to you – in accordance with the requirements of the [General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679) and applicable national laws – what personal data (in short, data) we as controllers – and those processors commissioned by us (e.g., providers) – process, will process in the future, and what lawful options you have. The terms used are to be understood in a gender-neutral manner.

In short: We comprehensively inform you about the data we process about you.

Privacy policies typically sound very technical and use legal jargon. However, this privacy policy is intended to describe the most important points as clearly and transparently as possible. Wherever possible, technical terms are explained in easy-to-understand language, links to further information are provided, and graphics are used. We thus inform you—in clear and plain language—that we process personal data in the course of our business only when a corresponding legal basis exists. This cannot be achieved if one provides overly brief, unclear, and legally technical explanations, as is often the case online when it comes to data protection. We hope that you find the following explanations interesting and informative—and that some information there might be new to you.

If you still have questions, please contact the responsible party listed below (or as provided in the imprint), follow the provided links, and refer to further information on third-party websites. Our contact details can also be found in the imprint.

## Scope of Application

This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us within the company as well as all personal data processed by companies (processors) commissioned by us. By personal data, we mean information as defined in Article 4 (1) GDPR, such as a person’s name, email address, or postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:

- All online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate
- Social media appearances and email communications
- Mobile apps for smartphones and other devices

In short: The privacy policy applies to all areas where personal data is structurally processed through the stated channels within our company. Should we enter into legal relations with you outside these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.

---

## Legal Bases

In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information regarding the legal principles and regulations – that is, the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation – which enable us to process personal data.

With regard to EU law, we refer to the **REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL** dated 27 April 2016. You can read this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on [EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679).

We process your data only if at least one of the following conditions applies:

1. **Consent** (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR):
   You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose – for example, storing the information you enter in a contact form.
2. **Contract** (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR):
   To fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we conclude a purchase contract with you, certain personal information is required in advance.
3. **Legal Obligation** (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR):
   We process your data if we are legally obligated to do so – for instance, to retain invoices for accounting purposes.
4. **Legitimate Interests** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR):
   In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we must process certain data to operate our website securely and economically. This processing is thus based on legitimate interests.

Additional conditions, such as processing in the public interest or for the exercise of official authority, generally do not apply to us. Should such a legal basis be relevant, it will be indicated in the respective section.

Furthermore, national laws also apply:

- **In Austria:** The Federal Act on the Protection of Natural Persons in Data Processing (Data Protection Act, abbreviated DSG).
- **In Germany:** The Federal Data Protection Act, abbreviated BDSG.

If additional regional or national laws apply, we will inform you in the following sections.

## Retention Period

As a general rule, we store personal data only as long as is absolutely necessary to provide our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for its processing ceases to exist. In certain cases, we are legally obligated to retain certain data even after the original purpose has ended (for accounting purposes, for instance).

If you wish to have your data deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, we will delete your data as promptly as possible, provided that no retention obligation exists.

We will provide further information on the specific retention period for each case in the subsequent sections if additional details are available.

## Rights Under the General Data Protection Regulation

Under Article 13 GDPR, you have the following rights to ensure fair and transparent data processing:

  - The duration of data storage
  - The right to rectification, deletion, or restriction of processing and the right to object
  - The source of the data if it was not collected from you
  - Whether profiling is carried out (i.e., if data is automatically evaluated to create a personal profile)
- **Right to Rectification (Article 16 GDPR):**
  You can demand that incorrect data be corrected.
- **Right to Erasure (Article 17 GDPR, “Right to be Forgotten”):**
  You can require the deletion of your data.
- **Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18 GDPR):**
  You can require that your data be stored but not further processed.
- **Right to Data Portability (Article 19 GDPR):**
  You can ask us to provide your data in a common format.
- **Right to Object (Article 21 GDPR):**
  You have the right to object to the processing of your data, which may result in changes to the processing if upheld:
  - If processing is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest or official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests), you can object.
  - If data is used for direct marketing, you can object at any time, after which your data will no longer be used for direct marketing.
  - If data is used for profiling, you can object at any time, and your data will no longer be used for profiling.
- **Right not to be Subject to Automated Decisions (Article 22 GDPR):**
  In some cases, you have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing (such as profiling).

In short: You have these rights – please do not hesitate to contact the above-mentioned responsible party if you wish to exercise any of them.

If you believe that the processing of your data contravenes data protection law or that your rights have been violated, you can file a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. In Austria, this is the [Data Protection Authority](https://www.dsb.gv.at/); in Germany, each federal state has its own Data Protection Commissioner. For further details, please contact the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI). For our company, the following local data protection authority is responsible.

## Cookies

### Cookies Summary

- **Affected:** Visitors of the website
- **Purpose:** Depends on the specific cookie. More details are provided in the following sections or by the software manufacturer that sets the cookie.
- **Processed Data:** Varies by cookie
- **Retention Period:** Varies depending on the cookie, from a few hours to several years
- **Legal Bases:** Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (Consent) and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (Legitimate Interests)

### What Are Cookies?

Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data. When you browse the internet, you use a browser – for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text files, known as cookies, in your browser.

Cookies serve as helpful tools—they can store, for example, language settings or personal site preferences. There are:
- **First-Party Cookies:** Created directly by our website.
- **Third-Party Cookies:** Created by partner websites (e.g., Google Analytics).

Each cookie stores different data and may have different expiration times (ranging from a few minutes to several years). Cookies are not programs, do not contain viruses or Trojan horses, and cannot access personal data on your computer.

*For example:*

- **Name:** _ga
- **Value:** GA1.2.1326744211.152311891618-9
- **Purpose:** Distinguishing website visitors
- **Expiration:** After 2 years

A browser should support at least:
- 4096 bytes per cookie
- 50 cookies per domain
- 3000 cookies in total

### What Types of Cookies Exist?

Depending on the service, cookies are used in different ways. Generally, one distinguishes four categories:

- **Essential Cookies:** Necessary to ensure the basic functions of the website (e.g., keeping a shopping cart intact even if you leave the site).
- **Analysis Cookies:** Collect information about user behavior and any error messages.

Typically, upon visiting a website for the first time, you are asked which types of cookies you wish to allow; this decision is then stored in a cookie.

If you want to learn more about cookies, we recommend reviewing [RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) by the IETF, titled “HTTP State Management Mechanism.”

## Web analysis and optimization

We use tools for web analysis and reach measurement so that we can evaluate visitor flows on our website. For this purpose, we collect information about the behavior, interests or demographic information of our visitors, such as age, gender or similar. This helps us to recognize at what time our online offer, its functions or content are most frequented or invite repeated visits. We can also use the information collected to determine whether our online offering needs to be optimized or adapted.

The information collected for this purpose is stored in cookies or similar procedures and is used for range measurement and optimization. The data stored in the cookies may include content viewed, online presences visited, settings and functions and systems used. As a rule, however, no clear user data is processed for the purposes described. In this case, the data is modified in such a way that neither we nor the provider of the tool used know the actual identity of the user. The data modified in this way is often stored in user profiles.

## Purpose of Processing via Cookies

The purpose is ultimately dependent on the specific cookie. More details on this can be found in the sections below or by referring to the respective software manufacturer's documentation.

---

## What Data Is Processed? (Cookies)

Cookies serve as small assistants for various tasks. It is not possible to generalize which data is stored in cookies, but in this privacy policy, we will inform you about the data that is processed or stored.

---

## Retention Period for Cookies

The duration for which a cookie is stored depends on the specific cookie. Some cookies are deleted within less than an hour, while others may be stored on your computer for several years.

You also have control over the retention period by manually deleting cookies via your browser settings. Cookies based on consent are deleted at the latest after you revoke your consent, although the legality of their storage remains unaffected until that point.

---

## Right to Object – How Can I Delete Cookies?

How and whether you use cookies is entirely up to you. Regardless of the cookie's source, you always have the option to delete, disable, or partially allow cookies—for example, you can block third-party cookies while allowing others.

If you wish to view the cookies stored in your browser, change your cookie settings, or delete cookies, please refer to your browser's settings:

- **Chrome:** [Delete, enable, and manage cookies in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en)  
- **Safari:** [Manage cookies and website data with Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac)  
- **Firefox:** [Delete cookies to remove data that websites have stored on your computer](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-data-websites-stored-your-computer)  
- **Internet Explorer:** [Delete and manage cookies](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/manage-cookies-in-internet-explorer-9c3e70f9-41b1-74d8-b0d0-841e0b68e4c3)  
- **Microsoft Edge:** [Delete and manage cookies](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)  

If you do not wish to have any cookies at all, you can configure your browser to always notify you before a cookie is set, allowing you to decide individually.

---

## Legal Basis (Cookies)

Since 2009, there have been so-called “cookie guidelines” stating that the storage of cookies requires your consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR). However, responses vary among EU countries. In Austria, this directive was implemented in § 96 Abs. 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG), while in Germany it has largely been implemented in § 15 Abs.3 of the Telemedia Act (TMG).

For essential cookies, even without consent, legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) may exist, which are usually of an economic nature in order to provide a good user experience. Cookies that are not absolutely necessary are set only with your consent.

## Web Hosting

### Web Hosting Summary

- **Affected:** Visitors of the website  
- **Purpose:** Professional hosting of the website and ensuring its operation
- **Processed Data:** IP address, time of website visit, browser used, and additional data (varies by provider)
- **Retention Period:** Generally 2 weeks
- **Legal Bases:** Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (Legitimate Interests)

### What Is Web Hosting?

Web hosting refers to the provision of storage and computing power for hosting websites. It encompasses all the webpages within a domain—for example, everything from the homepage to the last subpage (e.g., example.com or sampleexample.com).

To view a website, you use a browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari). The browser connects to a web server where the website’s code is stored. The operation of a web server is a complex and labor-intensive task, and professional providers typically manage web hosting to ensure reliable and error-free storage of website data.

During the connection between your browser and the web server, personal data may be processed. Your browser stores data, and the web server must also store data for a certain period to ensure proper operation.

---

## Why Do We Process Personal Data? (Web Hosting)

The purposes of data processing in web hosting include:

1. Professional hosting of the website and ensuring its operation
2. Maintaining operational and IT security
3. Anonymous analysis of access behavior to improve our offering and, if necessary, to pursue legal claims

---

## What Data Is Processed? (Web Hosting)

While you visit our website, our web server automatically stores data such as:

- The complete URL of the accessed page (e.g., `https://www.examplewebsite.com/samplepage.html?tid=311891618`)
- Browser and browser version (e.g., Chrome 87)
- The operating system used (e.g., Windows 10)
- The URL of the previously visited page (referrer URL), e.g., `https://www.sourcewebsite.com/`
- The hostname and IP address of the accessing device (e.g., `COMPUTERNAME` and `194.23.43.121`)
- Date and time

This data is stored in webserver log files.

---

## How Long Is Data Stored? (Web Hosting)

Generally, the above-mentioned data is stored for about two weeks and then automatically deleted. We do not share these data, although we cannot rule out that, in the event of unlawful behavior, authorities might view these logs.

In short: Your visit is logged by our provider, but we will not share your data without your consent.

---

## Legal Basis (Web Hosting)

The legality of processing personal data in the context of web hosting is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (protection of legitimate interests), as the use of professional hosting is necessary to present the company securely and user-friendly on the internet and to pursue claims in the event of an attack or other issues.

Usually, there is a contract between us and the hosting provider for processing according to Article 28 GDPR, which ensures data protection and guarantees data security.
