# Building Secure Federated Models with Homomorphic Encryption and MPC

Federated learning has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative model training while keeping data decentralized. However, standard federated learning still faces security challenges, particularly around model update privacy and potential information leakage. Advanced cryptographic techniques—specifically homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multi-party computation (MPC)—provide powerful tools to address these concerns and build truly secure federated models.

## The Privacy Gap in Standard Federated Learning

While basic federated learning keeps raw data local, several vulnerabilities remain:

1. **Update Inference Attacks**: Sophisticated attackers can sometimes reconstruct training data from model updates
2. **Model Inversion**: The central aggregator could potentially extract sensitive information from received updates
3. **Secure Aggregation Needs**: Ensuring that individual updates remain private even during the aggregation process
4. **Collusion Risks**: Multiple participants could potentially collude to compromise privacy

Advanced cryptographic methods address these challenges by adding mathematical guarantees to the privacy-preserving properties of federated systems.

## Homomorphic Encryption: Computing on Encrypted Data

### Fundamentals of Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without requiring decryption first. The result, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext.

There are several types of homomorphic encryption schemes:

- **Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)**: Supports a single operation (addition OR multiplication)
- **Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE)**: Supports both operations but for a limited number of operations
- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**: Supports arbitrary computations on encrypted data

### Application in Federated Learning

In a federated learning context, homomorphic encryption can be applied in several ways:

#### 1. Encrypted Model Updates

Each participant encrypts their model updates before sending them to the central aggregator:

\`\`\`
// Conceptual process
LocalModel = TrainLocalModel(LocalData)
ModelUpdate = LocalModel - GlobalModel
EncryptedUpdate = HE.Encrypt(ModelUpdate, PublicKey)
SendToAggregator(EncryptedUpdate)
\`\`\`

The aggregator then performs homomorphic addition on the encrypted updates:

\`\`\`
// At the aggregator
EncryptedAggregateUpdate = HE.Add(EncryptedUpdate1, EncryptedUpdate2, ..., EncryptedUpdateN)
EncryptedNewGlobalModel = HE.Add(EncryptedAggregateUpdate, EncryptedGlobalModel)
\`\`\`

The new global model is then decrypted using a threshold decryption scheme, where multiple participants must cooperate to perform the decryption, preventing any single entity from accessing individual updates.

#### 2. Privacy-Preserving Predictions

Homomorphic encryption can also enable privacy-preserving inference:

\`\`\`
// Client encrypts input
EncryptedInput = HE.Encrypt(UserData, PublicKey)

// Server computes on encrypted data
EncryptedPrediction = Model.Predict(EncryptedInput)

// Client decrypts result
Prediction = HE.Decrypt(EncryptedPrediction, PrivateKey)
\`\`\`

### Practical Considerations

While powerful, homomorphic encryption comes with challenges:

- **Computational Overhead**: FHE operations can be thousands of times slower than plaintext operations
- **Ciphertext Expansion**: Encrypted data is significantly larger than plaintext
- **Noise Management**: Many HE schemes accumulate noise with each operation, requiring careful management
- **Scheme Selection**: Different HE schemes offer various tradeoffs in efficiency and capabilities

In practice, using Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption with carefully designed computational graphs often provides the best balance of security and performance for federated learning applications.

## Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

### MPC Fundamentals

Secure Multi-Party Computation allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. Unlike HE, which typically involves encryption, MPC uses various cryptographic protocols to split computations across participants.

Key MPC approaches include:

- **Secret Sharing**: Data is split into shares, with each party holding a share
- **Garbled Circuits**: Boolean circuits are "garbled" to hide input values while preserving functionality
- **Oblivious Transfer**: Allows a party to transfer one of multiple items without knowing which item was selected

### MPC in Federated Learning

MPC can enhance federated learning security in several ways:

#### 1. Secure Aggregation

MPC provides protocols for securely aggregating model updates without revealing individual contributions:

\`\`\`
// Each participant i
shares_i = SecretShare(ModelUpdate_i)
DistributeShares(shares_i)

// Each participant receives shares from others
aggregated_share = Sum(received_shares)

// Collectively reconstruct
GlobalUpdate = Reconstruct(aggregated_share_1, ..., aggregated_share_n)
\`\`\`

#### 2. Secure Model Evaluation

MPC allows collaborative evaluation of models on sensitive data:

\`\`\`
// Party A with model, Party B with data
model_shares = PartyA.SecretShare(Model)
data_shares = PartyB.SecretShare(Data)

// Both parties compute on shares
prediction_shares_A = ComputeOnShares(model_shares, data_shares)
prediction_shares_B = ComputeOnShares(model_shares, data_shares)

// Reconstruct prediction
Prediction = Reconstruct(prediction_shares_A, prediction_shares_B)
\`\`\`

### Practical Considerations

MPC offers different tradeoffs compared to homomorphic encryption:

- **Communication Overhead**: Many MPC protocols require multiple rounds of communication
- **Collusion Resistance**: Different MPC protocols offer various guarantees against collusion
- **Computational Distribution**: Computation is distributed across participants rather than concentrated
- **Flexibility**: MPC can support almost any computation with appropriate protocol design

## Combining HE and MPC for Enhanced Security

The most sophisticated federated learning systems often combine HE and MPC to leverage the strengths of each approach:

### Hybrid Protocol Example

1. **Local Computation**: Each participant trains models locally
2. **Homomorphic Encryption**: Model updates are encrypted with HE
3. **MPC for Aggregation**: A secure MPC protocol is used for aggregating encrypted updates
4. **Threshold Decryption**: Multiple parties participate in decrypting only the final aggregated model

This combined approach provides strong security guarantees:
- Individual updates remain encrypted
- No single party can access individual contributions
- The aggregation process itself is secured through MPC
- Only the final aggregated result is revealed

## Implementation in PrivateAIM's FLAME Platform

PrivateAIM's FLAME platform implements these advanced cryptographic techniques to provide secure federated learning for healthcare and other sensitive domains:

### Key Security Features

1. **Encrypted Model Transport**: All model updates are encrypted during transmission
2. **Secure Aggregation Protocols**: Custom MPC protocols ensure that individual contributions remain private
3. **Configurable Security Levels**: Organizations can select appropriate security-performance tradeoffs
4. **Threshold Cryptography**: Multiple participants must cooperate for key operations
5. **Differential Privacy Integration**: Cryptographic protections are complemented by differential privacy guarantees

### Practical Example: Secure Medical Image Analysis

In a typical medical imaging collaboration using FLAME:

1. Multiple hospitals train local models on their patient scans
2. Model updates are encrypted using lattice-based homomorphic encryption
3. A secure aggregation protocol combines updates without revealing individual hospital contributions
4. The resulting global model benefits from diverse training data while preserving patient privacy
5. Additional differential privacy noise is added to prevent potential inference attacks

## Future Directions

Research in cryptographically enhanced federated learning continues to advance rapidly:

### Efficiency Improvements

- **Hardware Acceleration**: Specialized hardware for HE operations
- **Optimized Protocols**: Reduced communication rounds in MPC
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Selective application of cryptographic protections to sensitive parts of computation

### Enhanced Security Models

- **Malicious Security**: Protocols secure against actively malicious participants
- **Post-Quantum Security**: Preparation for quantum computing threats
- **Verifiable Computation**: Ensuring participants correctly follow protocols

### Expanded Applications

- **Cross-Silo Federated Learning**: Secure collaboration across organizational boundaries
- **Federated Analytics**: Beyond model training to secure distributed analytics
- **Privacy-Preserving MLOps**: Secure model monitoring and management

## Conclusion

Homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation represent powerful tools for enhancing the security of federated learning systems. While these techniques introduce computational and communication overhead, they provide mathematical guarantees of privacy that are increasingly essential when working with sensitive data.

As PrivateAIM continues to develop the FLAME platform, these advanced cryptographic techniques serve as foundational elements of our security architecture, enabling truly privacy-preserving collaboration across organizational boundaries. By combining the best of federated learning with state-of-the-art cryptography, we are helping to build a future where data utility and privacy protection can coexist.

For organizations looking to implement secure federated learning systems, understanding these cryptographic building blocks is essential to making informed decisions about security-performance tradeoffs and selecting appropriate protocols for specific use cases.

# Decentralized AUC Computation: Innovations and Insights

The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC or simply AUC) is one of the most important evaluation metrics for classification models, particularly in medical applications. However, computing this metric in a federated learning environment, where data cannot be shared across participants, presents significant challenges. This article explores innovative approaches to decentralized AUC computation and their implementation in federated learning systems.

## Understanding AUC and Its Significance

Before diving into decentralized computation methods, let's briefly review what AUC is and why it matters, especially in healthcare contexts.

### What is AUC?

The AUC represents the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance. Mathematically, it's calculated as the area under the ROC curve, which plots the True Positive Rate (sensitivity) against the False Positive Rate (1-specificity) at various threshold settings.

AUC values range from 0 to 1, where:
- 0.5 indicates a model with no discriminative ability (equivalent to random guessing)
- Values closer to 1 indicate better performance
- Values below 0.5 suggest the model is worse than random guessing (and could be improved by inverting its predictions)

### Why AUC Matters in Healthcare

Several factors make AUC particularly valuable in medical applications:

1. **Threshold Invariance**: AUC evaluates model performance across all possible classification thresholds
2. **Class Imbalance Robustness**: Effective for rare disease diagnosis where positive cases are much fewer than negative cases
3. **Interpretability**: Directly represents the probability of correct ranking between classes
4. **Clinical Relevance**: Aligns with the medical goal of correctly distinguishing between healthy and diseased states

## The Challenge of Federated AUC Computation

In traditional centralized settings, computing AUC is straightforward—we collect all predictions and ground truth labels, then calculate the metric. In federated environments, however, this approach breaks down because:

1. **Data Privacy**: Raw patient data cannot leave local institutions
2. **Regulatory Constraints**: Healthcare data is subject to strict regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)
3. **Distributed Nature**: Patient records are naturally distributed across hospitals
4. **Statistical Considerations**: Each institution may have different data distributions

## Approaches to Decentralized AUC Computation

Several innovative methods have been developed to address these challenges, each with different privacy-utility tradeoffs.

### 1. Vertical Partitioning Approaches

In settings where different features of the same patients are held by different institutions (vertical partitioning), specialized protocols are required:

#### Method: Secure Bipartite Ranking

This approach handles the case where labels are held by one party and features by another:

\`\`\`
// Conceptual algorithm
1. Party A has labels y
2. Party B has features X and computes predictions p
3. Using secure comparison protocol:
   - For each pair of examples (i,j)
   - Securely determine if (p_i > p_j AND y_i > y_j) OR (p_i < p_j AND y_i < y_j)
4. Count correctly ranked pairs
5. Compute AUC = (correctly ranked pairs) / (total pairs)
\`\`\`

### 2. Horizontal Partitioning Approaches

More common in healthcare is horizontal partitioning, where different patients' complete records are held by different institutions.

#### Method: Histogram-Based Approximation

A privacy-preserving approach using binned predictions:

\`\`\`
// At each participant
1. Compute local model predictions
2. Create histograms of prediction distributions for positive and negative classes
3. Securely share histogram counts (with privacy mechanisms)

// At aggregator
4. Combine histograms from all participants
5. Approximate AUC from combined histograms
\`\`\`

#### Method: Partial AUC Aggregation

This approach computes partial statistics locally that can be combined centrally:

\`\`\`
// At each participant
1. Compute model predictions p_i on local data
2. Calculate local positive and negative counts: n_pos, n_neg
3. For each threshold t:
   - Calculate local TPR_t and FPR_t
4. Share (n_pos, n_neg, TPR_t, FPR_t) for various thresholds

// At aggregator
5. Compute global TPR_t = sum(local_TPR_t * local_n_pos) / sum(local_n_pos)
6. Compute global FPR_t = sum(local_FPR_t * local_n_neg) / sum(local_n_neg)
7. Calculate AUC using the trapezoidal rule on the global (FPR_t, TPR_t) points
\`\`\`

### 3. Secure Multi-Party Computation Approaches

For maximum security, fully encrypted computation methods can be used:

#### Method: Fully Homomorphic Encryption

This approach maintains security even against a curious aggregator:

\`\`\`
// At each participant
1. Compute local predictions p_i
2. Encrypt predictions and labels: Enc(p_i), Enc(y_i)
3. Share encrypted values with aggregator

// At aggregator (working on encrypted data)
4. For all pairs across sites (i,j):
   - Homomorphically compute if p_i > p_j
   - Homomorphically compute if y_i != y_j
   - Homomorphically compute correct ranking
5. Aggregate results homomorphically
6. Participants collaboratively decrypt final AUC
\`\`\`

#### Method: Secure Rank Correlation

Based on the equivalence between AUC and the rank correlation statistics:

\`\`\`
// At each participant
1. Generate secret shares of predictions and labels
2. Distribute shares to other participants

// Collaboratively
3. Use MPC to compute ranks of predictions and labels
4. Use MPC to compute correlation between prediction ranks and actual labels
5. Convert rank correlation to AUC metric
\`\`\`
